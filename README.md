# Rock-Paper-Scissors
The aim of this project was to code a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, a more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, which can be played against the computer.

before the start of the game, the user will be able to choose the options that will be used. After entering his/her name, the user should provide a list of options separated by a comma. For example,

rock,paper,scissors,lizard,spock

If the user inputs an empty line, your program should start the game with default options: rock. paper and scissors.
